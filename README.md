# inst126-intro-programming-notes

I ([Joel Chan](http://joelchan.me/)) am experimenting with hosting lecture notes for INST126 (Intro to Programming for Information Science) in [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) format, for enhanced usability and searchability. 

This is an ongoing work in progress.

<p>When there is <em>any</em> mismatch between your directions and the real world, Python will choke and give you the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FileNotFoundError:</span> <span class="pre">[Errno</span> <span class="pre">2]</span> <span class="pre">No</span> <span class="pre">such</span> <span class="pre">file</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">directory:</span> <span class="pre">...</span></code></p>
<p>Many of you have been facing problems with Files that were variants of this problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your mental model of where the file is was correct, but you were missing or misspelling one or more elements in the path</p></li>
<li><p>Your mental model of where the file is was inccorrect</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The general fix is to remove the mismatch between your directions and the real world. The specifics depends on the nature of the mismatch, which you need to diagnose, like a doctor! Make yes/no hypotheses, a means to test them, and rule them out one by one until you come to the right diagnosis.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-library">
<h2>What is a library?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-library" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>You can think of a library is a <strong>collection of functions and data structures</strong>. You <em>import</em> a library (or subsets of it) into your program / notebook so you have access to special functions or data structures in your program.</p>
<p>You are already using Python’s standard library, which includes built-in functions like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print()</span></code>, and built-in data structures like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>. Every time you fire up Python, these are “imported” into your program in the background.</p>
<p>As you advance in your programming career, you will often find that you want to solve some (sub)problems that others have tried to do, and wrote a collection of functions and/or data structures to solve those problems really well, and saved that collection into a library that others can use. Take advantage of this!</p>

<h2>“importing” a library: mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-a-library-mechanics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Here’s what it looks like to import a library and use it, conceptually with a “fake” library, and with the pandas library</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F0P_oLpCNzy.png?alt=media&amp;token=0908b80b-a761-4588-85b5-7c87bee6bf0e" /></p>
<p>We often want to import libraries with “as”</p>
<p>The name after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">as</span></code> is sort of like a variable name; usually we do that if the library name is clunky, or might conflict with variable names we want to use</p>
<p>For pandas, by convention people usually import it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">pd</span></code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FLJ66aL66zf.png?alt=media&amp;token=e0ae487c-910f-48bc-a8f2-ac42424009a9" /></p>

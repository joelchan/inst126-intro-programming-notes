    "# 11: Pandas for data analysis with Python: Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we learned:\n",
    "- Pandas is a library in Python that is designed for data manipulation and analysis\n",
    "- How to use libraries (import them, access their functions and data structures with `library.function_name()`)\n",
    "- About the `dataframe` data structure: basically a smart spreadsheet, with rows of observations, and columns of variables/data for each observation - sort of a cross between a list (sortable, indexable) and a dictionary (quickly access data by key)\n",
    "- Some basic operations: constructing a dataframe, summarizing, subsetting, reshaping\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we'll most dig into more advanced operations for reshaping/modifying your dataframe:\n",
    "- Use `.apply()` to apply functions to one or more columns to generate new columns\n",
    "- Use `.groupby()` to split your data into subgroups, apply some function to their data, then combine them into a new dataframe for further analysis (the \"**split-apply-combine**\" pattern that is fundamental to data analysis with pandas)\n",
    "- Use some basic plotting functions to explore your data\n",
    "\n",
    "These roughly correspond to Qs 6-8 in your PCEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have time, we'll learn a bit more about summarization:\n",
    "- Use `.value_counts()` to summarize categorical data\n",
    "- How to plot data"

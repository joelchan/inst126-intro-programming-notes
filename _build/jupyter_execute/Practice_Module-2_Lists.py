# # Practice: Lists
# 
# ## 1: list of numbers

# In[1]:


a = 15
b = 2
c = 10
d = 13
e = 18
f = 22
g = 19
h = 25


# ### 1A: Make the list and check it
# 
# Put these into a list and name it `numbers`.

# In[ ]:





# How long is the list?

# In[ ]:





# Get the 3rd item

# In[ ]:





# Write a function to get the item from a user-defined position, but include a check to make sure you don't try to get something from a position that doesn't exist in the list!

# In[ ]:





# ### 1B: Modify the list
# 
# Add the number 32 to the beginning of `numbers`

# In[ ]:





# Add the number 13 to the end of `numbers`

# In[ ]:





# Sort `numbers` in ascending order.

# In[ ]:





# Sort the list again (in reverse numeric order, from biggest to smallest), but keep the old list unchanged! Name the new list `big_to_small`. Show the first item from both lists.

# In[ ]:





# ### 1C: Math 
# 
# Get the smallest and largest numbers from `numbers`

# In[ ]:





# Compute the average

# In[ ]:





# ## 2: list of strings

# In[2]:


name1 = "Kumiyo"
name2 = "Naielia"
name3 = "Charlie"
name4 = "Juan"
name5 = "Renee"
name6 = "Kumiyo"
name7 = "Frank"
name8 = "Charlie"
name9 = "Kumiyo"
name10 = "Narges"
name11 = "Kumiyo"


# ### 2A: make and inspect the list 
# 
# Put these into a list and name it `people`.

# In[ ]:





# Grab the first 4 people off the list

# In[ ]:





# Grab the last 5 people off the list

# In[ ]:





# How many people are named "Charlie"? How about "Kumiyo"?

# In[ ]:





# ### 2B: Modify the list
# 
# Add three people named "Niklas" to the list of `people`.

# In[ ]:





# Sort the list in reverse alphabetical order, but keep the original list untouched! Name the new list `sortedPeople`.

# In[ ]:





# ### 2D: Write a program that filters the list so only people with a (user-defined input) name can get off the list.

We'll discuss debugging in more detail in the next module, but for now, just be aware that bugs can be silent like this. The key idea, which we will expand on later, is to always be mindful of the (potential) difference between 1) what you want to happen, and 2) what Python actually does, which is what produces the output you can see/inspect."
